# Excel Sales Analysis Dashboard

The primary objective of the Sales Analysis Dashboard is to provide a visual representation of the company's sales data. The dashboard is designed to enable quick and easy analysis, allowing stakeholders to make informed decisions. 

Data Source:
The data utilized for this dashboard is sourced from the company’s sales records, which include information on the order number, employee details, sales region, order date, customer information, product details, and order totals.

Key Features:

Sales Trends Over Time:
The dashboard features a line chart that displays the sales trends over time. This chart is essential for identifying patterns or fluctuations in sales, which may be influenced by various factors such as seasonality, marketing campaigns, or changes in customer preferences. The x-axis represents the time (in months or years), while the y-axis represents the total sales amount.

Sales by State:
This feature provides a geographical representation of sales data using a map. Each state is color-coded based on the total sales amount, allowing for a quick comparison of sales performance across different states. This can help the management in identifying potential markets or areas needing improvement.

Item Sales Breakdown:
A pie chart is utilized to display the percentage of sales attributed to each product category, such as Olive Oil, Gift Baskets, etc. This provides insights into which product categories are most popular among customers and contribute the most to the company's revenue.

Sales by Job Title:
A bar graph is included to illustrate the sales performance based on employee job titles, such as Senior Sales Associate, Sales Manager, etc. This can help in analyzing the effectiveness and productivity of different roles within the sales team.

Sales by Region:
Another bar graph shows the total sales broken down by sales regions (e.g., S Central East, North West, etc.). This data is critical for evaluating regional performance and can support decision-making regarding resource allocation and regional strategies.

Filters:
The dashboard includes robust filtering options, allowing users to view data based on specific criteria. Filters available are:
a. Sales Region - to view data for a particular sales region.
b. Quarters - to analyze quarterly sales data.
c. Years - to observe yearly trends and performance.

Technology:
This dashboard is created using Microsoft Excel, leveraging its data visualization tools and pivot tables for aggregating and analyzing the sales data.

Insights/Findings:

Top Performing Regions:
S Central East region is the top-performing region with total sales amounting to $339,688.05. N Central East and Central East follow closely, with sales of $269,898.11 and $251,751.40 respectively. These regions could be the key revenue drivers for the company and may have a strong customer base or effective sales strategies.

Dominance of Olive Oil Sales:
Olive Oil significantly dominates the sales with a total of $1,533,163.75, which forms a substantial part of the grand total sales of $1,708,701.80. This indicates that Olive Oil is the company's flagship product and is likely to be highly popular among customers.

Year-on-Year Growth in 2020:
In the year 2020, there was a significant growth in sales compared to 2019. The grand total sales for 2020 were $925,982.34, which is approximately 25.6% higher than the sales of $737,903.60 in 2019. This indicates that 2020 was a strong year for the company in terms of sales.

Decline in Sales in 2021:
There was a drastic drop in sales in 2021, with total sales amounting to just $44,815.86. This is a major decline compared to the previous years and could be due to various factors such as market changes, competition, or external factors like economic downturns. It's crucial for the company to analyze the cause of this decline and take corrective measures.

Sales by Job Title:

Senior Sales Representative showed a substantial increase in sales from $111,012.59 in 2019 to $166,867.32 in 2020. However, this category also faced a steep decline in 2021.
Sales Associate I consistently performed well in both 2019 and 2020, showing an increase in sales.
Sales Representative and Senior Sales Associate job titles are stable contributors in 2019 and 2020.
It's important to note that all job titles faced a decline in sales in 2021. This might suggest an external factor affecting sales irrespective of the job title.

States with Highest Sales:
California has the highest sales, with an order total of $194,841.78, followed by Texas with $234,689.19 and Florida with $140,819.55. These states are likely to have a large customer base and possibly a wider distribution network. The company should continue to monitor and optimize its strategies in these states to maintain high performance.

States with Lowest Sales:
Montana, North Dakota, and Wyoming have the lowest sales with totals of $1,240.95, $1,369.79, and $73.47 respectively. The significantly low sales in these states could be due to various factors such as a smaller market, less demand for the products, or inadequate marketing efforts. It's important to analyze the reasons behind the low sales and consider tailored strategies for these states.

Yearly Sales Growth and Decline:
Sales grew from the year 2019 to 2020, with totals of $737,903.60 and $925,982.34 respectively. This represents an approximate growth of 25.5%. However, in 2021 there was a sharp decline with sales only totaling $44,815.86 in January. It is important to analyze the reason for this sudden drop. It could be due to various factors such as market changes, competition, external factors like economic downturns or the data for the rest of 2021 might be unavailable.

Seasonal Trends:
In both 2019 and 2020, sales were high during May, August, October, and December. This suggests a seasonal trend where sales peak during these months. May and December could be attributed to holidays such as Mother’s Day and Christmas, whereas, for August and October, further analysis could be done to understand the reason for high sales.
